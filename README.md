## Day 15

Follow the instructions

## Day 16

Light reflection and beam splitting

## Day 17 

Dijkstra's algorithm

## Day 18

Distance collapse and area calculation

## Day 19

Range splitting

## Day 20

Follow instructions. This one depended on manually finding out things about the
graph that was created and so far probably the worst problem

## Day 21

Very good problem. Polynomial interpolation with an educated guess at cycle
lengths for this to be valid. 

## Day 22

Spacial supporting and dfs

## Day 23

Graph building and longest path finding

## Day 24

Line intersection and building an equation and passing it to a solver.  Part 1
was pretty good but part 2 fell flat for me. I wonder if there is an approach
that creates linearity but honestly feels like my solution was fine.

## Day 25
